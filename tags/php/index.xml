      <description>Being a command-line geek myself, it can be a massive pain in the ass not having SSH access to a client&amp;rsquo;s hosting service. Simple things like finding where a previous developer has declared some variable or template code can become what feels like a never-ending nightmare.
Never mind dear, PHP to the rescue…

      <title>Convert bytes to readable units in Perl/Java/PHP</title>

      <description>I recently used code similar to that below in VPSMon, and came across a need where it would be convenient to display bytes as a more human-friendly string in Perl. Basically I’m building a script, and I want to convert the amount of available/free RAM on a machine from bytes to gigabytes for display to a user, but I figured may as well cover all bases and have this around in case it needs to display other units/multiples in the future.</description>
