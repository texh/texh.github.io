      <title>Getting up and running with Nginx [CentOS]</title>

      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;m on the topic of upgrading and installing server software, why not go quickly into how I get nginx set up on my centOS boxes.
It&amp;rsquo;s a super simple process as there&amp;rsquo;s an official RHEL/centOS nginx yum repository.
Basically, given a new server I would remove apache/httpd with
yum remove httpd Then create a file named /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo and paste the configuration below within it:
[nginx] name=nginx repo baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/$releasever/$basearch/ gpgcheck=0 enabled=1 Then it&amp;rsquo;s a simply matter of running</description>

      <title>Installing Perl from source</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve done this a few times now, and every time I go to Google to find the same article just to make sure that I follow similar, if not the same, steps.
You may be thinking &amp;ldquo;Ch&amp;rsquo;yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s just a simple configure, make, make install&amp;rdquo;, or a quick poke on the Yum stick, but maybe not. It is a good idea to keep &amp;lsquo;The Old Perl&amp;rsquo; (generally 5.8.8 as I&amp;rsquo;m a centOS sucker) as removing it via yum would remove a whole bunch of other things that rely on it.</description>

      <title>Change centOS local timezone</title>

      <description>So today I was taking a look at those lovely lovely photos that I brought over to the blog from instagram, and rearranging some other bits and pieces, when I realised that the timestamps on said images were well off what times I remembered actually taking the photos..
So I took a look at what the &amp;lsquo;date&amp;rsquo; command had to say on my server, and low and behold it was set to an obscure timezone that is really of no use to me.</description>
