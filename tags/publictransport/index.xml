      <description>Tonight after leaving my house for work I was thoroughly dismayed when I found that I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to grab my MyKi smartcard before running for the train.
I remember a day not all too long ago when this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an issue. You would simply buy a two-hour metcard ticket and be on your way. However tonight after fare evading on the country train I catch to the city, it was much to my discontent that there are now officially no longer any metcard machines in service on the CBD network.</description>
