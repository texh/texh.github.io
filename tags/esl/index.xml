      <description>After a little back and forth on the topic of tonight&amp;rsquo;s Language Corner, we settled on poetry and creative language. Both ideas were sourced from asking ESL learners what kind of content they would actually like to see.
At first glance, Jabberwock may not be the most intuitive piece of work to use in an ESL setting. The vast majority of the text is nonsensical gibberish. I think this poem could do well to help get students to think outside the box and attempt to express their thoughts in more creative ways.</description>
