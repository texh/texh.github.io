      <description>For a while now I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking on a few Sails.js based projects, my long-running pet project ZHDict being one of them.
After hacking on some Hexo themes, the first of which (which you&amp;rsquo;re currently looking at) uses Pug templating (the template engine formerly known as Jade) behind the scenes to render the HTML, and I&amp;rsquo;ve kinda grown to like it. You can think of pug as the love-child creation of Python and HTML after a steamy night of flipping bits.</description>

      <description>After having somewhat of a heated Facebook conversation with a friend about the Ups and Downs of various web frameworks, I was inspired to benchmark a simple &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; to compare the speed and resource usage of Node.js and the Play! Framework (using Java).
Being mostly Perl guys ourselves, my go-to tool for web wizardry is generally the awesome Catalyst MVC framework, can&amp;rsquo;t say the same about my friend.
All the tests below were completed on my Laptop â€“ Intel Core i5 M480 CPU @ 2.</description>
