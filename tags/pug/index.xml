      <description>For a while now I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking on a few Sails.js based projects, my long-running pet project ZHDict being one of them.
After hacking on some Hexo themes, the first of which (which you&amp;rsquo;re currently looking at) uses Pug templating (the template engine formerly known as Jade) behind the scenes to render the HTML, and I&amp;rsquo;ve kinda grown to like it. You can think of pug as the love-child creation of Python and HTML after a steamy night of flipping bits.</description>
